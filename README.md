# Claim It Up

## Automated Motor Insurance Claim Verification
A service that can automate verification of claim files including policy holder and vehicle details in multiple formats such as scanned documents and picture from claim surveyors.
Provide AI based cost estimation of insurance claim amount by analyzing the vehicle damage using visual recognition from the image of the damaged vehicle.

## PROBLEM
The insurance industry runs on vast reservoirs of data, dealing with mixed formats of data including both paper and electronic documents.
The manual effort to extract information from these documents and different data sources is time consuming, costly and prone to errors.
In addition to this, is the increased cases of fraud in the insurance companies, where the surveyors give a rough estimate of the insurance amount and not the exact value.

## What we are doing?
1) Input all the required documents.
2) Pre processing of the images using Optical Character
Recognition (OCR)
3) Validation and Cross Validation
4) Comparison with authoritative data
5) Result whether the claim is valid or not
6) Analyse the images of the vehicle
7) Classify the damages based using visual recognition
8) Give the estimated cost

## Why is this algorithm more accurate?
We have improved upon the accuracy of the verification by taking the probability of the extracted data which matches with the original data.
We calculate the count of every wrong character and compare it to get the best results and accordingly with respect to a threshold value set, provide the results of matching data.

## Future aspects
• Add Government validation using VAHAN api.
• Implementing payment gateway using Blockchain
technology.
• Working with large set of data instead of single dataset
having limited data to improve the accuracy of the model.
